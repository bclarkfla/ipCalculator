# ipCalculator
A simple IPv4 calculator written in Python3. It's relatively bare-bones, treats everything as classless, and does not validate user inputs. It does not check for reserved IP addresses such as 127.0.01. The user passes in the ip address and cidr number and the script outputs the lower bound and upper bound of the IP space, the subnet mask, and the number of available hosts.

It requires no none-standard Python modules.
